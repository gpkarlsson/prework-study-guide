# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created in order to have a centralized location for notes taken during the prework. I built this website because it was good practice, and it solved the problem of having to reference multiple files to find and read my notes. In creating this webpage, I learned how to create a easily readable webite with unordered lists. Each unordered list contains notes about the languages I learned to use while making this webpage: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this study guide, the notes in each section can be reviewed.Each of the different sections contains information about either HTML, CSS, Git, or JavaScript. Additionally, the DevTools console can be opened by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) to see the JavaScript running. In the DevTools console, a list of topics learned during the prework will be displayed, and a suggestion for which to study first will be displayed.
