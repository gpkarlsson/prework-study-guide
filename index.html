      <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visibile content being shown to the user.</li>
          <li>ul creates an unordered (bullet point) list, and li tag creates list items</li>
          <li>ol creates an ordered list, with numbers for each point</li>
          <li>h1 creates the largest heading and should only be used once per page</li>
          <li>h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>img tag contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>img tag can contain many elements, the most important of which is the src element, which defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>br can be used to create a line of empty space, also known as a line break</li>
          <li>The a tag creates links to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li>Within the a tag, the href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements - the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on the webpage</li>
          <li>div and span are non-semantic HTML elements</li>
          <li>div creates a division in the page</li>
          <li>span creates inline division</li>
          <li>Best practice is to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users</li>

        </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used to create style for the webpage</li>
          <li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage in order to make a website visually appealing</li>
          <li>CSS can also make a website simpler to use with a polished design and consistent organization</li>
          <li>CSS can be added either inline, with an internal style sheet, or an external style sheet</li>
          <li>Padding and Margin are often confused</li>
          <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>When we want to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page, we use a wild card symbol, or *</li>
          <li>Two or more selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule using a comma</li>
          <li>Applying style to certain elements, but not others, can be done by designating a class attribute as the selector</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stage changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m: add a commit message and commit changes</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls in the base branch to the feature branch</li>
          <li>git push: pushes up changes to remote repository</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="html-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript can be used to create interactivity on the webpage</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types - variables in JavaScriptare not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned and reassigned values of all types</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, the keyword <em>var</em> can be used to declare a variable</li>
          <li><em>Control flow</em> is the order in which a comptuer executes the code in a script</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from top to bottom</li>
          <li>Conditional statements, such as <em>if</em>, allow us to interrupt control flow</li>
          <li>An <em>Array</em> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>Not all arrays must have multiple data types</li>
          <li>A piece of data's location in an array is called an <em>index</em></li>
          <li>In JavaScript, indices always start at 0 and will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time</li>
          <li>A <em>for</em> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an arrayby allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements: starting point, condition, and a final statement that allows the array to iterate over each item</li>
          <li>A <em>variable</em> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
